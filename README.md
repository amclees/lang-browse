# LangBrowse

LangBrowse is a Firefox WebExtension to assist with learning new vocabulary in Japanese (support for other languages may be added eventually). It displays relevant words to whatever page is currently being viewed, making new vocabulary easily accessible anytime.

LangBrowse is not currently available in the Firefox addon listing and is still under development. If you would like to try it, you can clone this repository and follow [these instructions on how to load an unpackaged WebExtension into Firefox](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Add-ons/WebExtensions/Your_first_WebExtension#Installing).

When it is first loaded, LangBrowse will load its dictionaries into memory which may cause a Firefox to slow down for several seconds.
